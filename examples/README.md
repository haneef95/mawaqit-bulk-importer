# Notes
1. All the files in this folder works with the extension.
2. The ones beginning with `test_` are non-ideal, but still works.
3. The ones with `_12hr_` requires enabling `Convert 12hr to 24hr` in the extension.
4. All of the times are in local format with DST and requires enabling of `Convert from DST to Standard Time`.
